# Project 3 - Library Registry

Our app is a library with both a user and an administrative side. The admin is able to register books to the library, have the checkout information, and overall edit various aspects of the books. The user is able to search for specific books using a search bar and can click on them to learn further information like author and description. In addition, we also included a filter that is able to search books from their genre. 

# List of Features / Project Summary
- Our frontend was built using React and React Router as a user interface in order to implement components like displaying each book, the searchbar, the genre filter, etc. 
- Our backend has a functioning JSON API built by the team using Express and Mongoose.
- Our administrative feature is our Gold (MVP) and was spearheaded by Scott, Silver (MVP) to our genre filter that was worked on by Amiel, and Bronze (MVP) to our clickable page feature worked on by Daniel. 
- Amiel took charge as Scrum leader and gathered progress from all team members. We held discussion topics each day of the project in order to catch up on the progress made and what features needed more attention. All members were in agreement when git pushes commits were made to the final project.
